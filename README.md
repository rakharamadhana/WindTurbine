# 🌬️ Wind Turbine Simulation

A simple yet interactive **Unity WebGL** project that simulates a wind turbine’s behavior based on wind speed and rotor size.  
Adjust parameters in real-time, watch the blades spin, and explore how wind energy works!

🎮 **[▶ Play the Demo](https://play.unity.com/en/games/96df6571-3ab6-4187-8fdf-420b83525431/wind-turbine-simulation)**

---

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time Wind Control** – Increase or decrease wind speed using input fields or buttons.
- **Rotor Scaling** – Adjust turbine rotor diameter and see the visual changes.
- **Audio Feedback** – Wind sound adjusts dynamically with speed.
- **Looping Animation** – Blades spin smoothly in response to settings.
- **WebGL Ready** – Runs directly in your browser (desktop & mobile supported).

---

## 🛠 Built With
- **Unity** – Game engine.
- **C#** – Gameplay logic & UI controls.
- **TextMeshPro** – Crisp UI text rendering.
- **Unity WebGL** – Cross-platform browser build.

---

## 📂 Project Structure (Key Scripts)
- `WindUIController.cs` – Handles wind speed input, clamping, and sound updates.
- `UniformScaleController.cs` – Manages rotor scaling and UI updates.
- `GlobalWindController.cs` – Syncs wind speed with game objects.
- `AudioManager.cs` – Plays and adjusts looping wind sound.

---

## 📦 How to Play
1. **Open the demo link** above in a supported browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
2. Use **input field** or **+/- buttons** to change wind speed.
3. Adjust **rotor size** to see the turbine’s scale change.
4. Listen for the **wind sound** changing with speed.
5. Watch the turbine spin faster or slower depending on your settings.
